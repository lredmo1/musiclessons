## Description

_Use of the website begins with a teacher login or signup action. Once logged in, teachers are taken to a dashboard where they have the option of music demonstration or classroom management._

_In the music demonstration session, teachers can see a digital piano with piano keys labeled and mapped to computer keyboard keys. To begin, the teacher clicks in the input box, which activates the audio, and then plays music using keyboard presses_

_When the user clicks on a question, the trivia board is replaced with a display of the question and an answer input section. The user can type in the answer and click the submit button. If the question is correct, the blue monster will move toward the plate of cookies. If the answer is wrong, he will move backward. The length of movement is smallest for easy questions and greatest for hard questions. The monster cannot move backward beyond the starting point. After the answer is submitted and the monster moves, the question display becomes text indicating whether the user answered correctly and a button for returning to the trivia board view to try another question. If the user successfully answers enough questions to move the monster completely across the screen to the plate of cookies, confetti falls on the screen, the trivia board and question display become a celebration view with an image of a quote about cookies and friendship, and the game is over. The page must be refreshed to play again._

* _Pulling questions from the trivia API based on the categories appearing in the top row of the trivia board and ensuring that a question is not repeated on multiple columns or rows of the trivia board_
* _Analyzing numeric values for difficulty level in the trivia API, converting those values to a numeric range, and assigning questions within those ranges to easy, medium, and hard levels on the trivia board_
* _Toggling view of multiple div sections based on use case in the game_

_The question input section includes string analysis to recognize correct answers in the following common API/user-input conflict cases when those conflicts do not affect the accuracy of the answer:_
